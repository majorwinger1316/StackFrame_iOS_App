# StackFrame iOS Application

## ðŸ“± Collapsible & Expandable Stack Frames in SwiftUI

This repository demonstrates how to build **collapsible and expandable stack frames** using **SwiftUI** â€” a powerful UI pattern used in modern apps like **CRED** and **coupon-based platforms** to enhance visual hierarchy and user experience.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how **stack frames** (UI blocks/sections) can be:

* Expanded to reveal **detailed content or history**
* Collapsed to **keep the UI clean and focused**

This design improves **visibility of past actions** and enhances **engagement** by providing intuitive, tap-driven UI transitions.

---

### ðŸŒŸ Use Cases

* **Rewards & Coupons** (e.g., CRED-style reward sections)
* **Transaction History**
* **Expandable Form Sections**
* **Progress Trackers or Learning Modules**

---

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack

* **Language:** Swift
* **Framework:** SwiftUI
* **Design Patterns:** Declarative UI, State-driven UI updates

---
